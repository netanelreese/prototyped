For my analysis I really played with the positioning of the different widgets and how they related to eachother in their specific groupings. In version one, I had the number of reviews and count of reviews seperated by the award checkboxes, so for version two I moved the count right under the average scoring to have a familiar grouping. In addition to this, I also fixed the size of the summary text box which looks way nicer being the same size of the comments box. With this improvement I used the principle of similarity with the similarness of the review number/score widgets. I also tweaked the grouping of each of the widgets so that it brings attention to each of the groups (summary/comments, awards+review stuff, poster and title, etc)
