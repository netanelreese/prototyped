For my analysis I really played with the positioning of the different widgets and how they related to eachother in their specific groupings. In version one, I had the number of reviews and count of reviews seperated by the award checkboxes, so for version two I moved the count right under the average scoring to have a familiar grouping. In addition to this, I also fixed the size of the summary text box which looks way nicer being the same size of the comments box.
